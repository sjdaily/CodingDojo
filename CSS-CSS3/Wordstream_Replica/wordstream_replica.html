			<h1>PPC - Achieve More Efficient Pay-Per Click (PPC) Marketing</h1>
			<p>
				<strong>PPC</strong> (
				<span>pay-per-click</span>) search marketing software offers a means for accomplishing two core requirements for PPC optimization:

			<!-- Start of unordered list -->
			<ul>
				<li>
					<h2>PPC Automation</h2> - While it would be impossible (and inadvisable!) to automate every aspect of 
						<span>pay-per-click advertising</span>, automating away from redundant, time-consuming tasks affords you a means of increasing productivity. Often, this means being able to produce an amount of work that would otherwise have been unachievable for your business
				</li>
				<li>
					<h2>PPC Management</h2> - 
						<span>PPC Management</span> refers to the maintenance and prioritization of 
						<span>paid search</span> marketing tasks. Being able to oversee various aspects of your account while assigning each item on a seemingly endless to-do list an appropriate value can make or break an 
						<span>online ad campaign</span>.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<!-- End of ul -->
			<p>WordStream's 
				<span>PPC Software</span> is specifically designed to aid in these two 
				<span>PPC search engine</span> marketing areas. This page will show you both the processes the software is automating for you, and the best course of action to take where workflow is concerned.
